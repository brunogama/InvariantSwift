# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Repository-specific operating instructions for coding agents.

This file defines how to operate in this repository.
For coding quality, validation, lint budgets, and definition of done, follow `RULES.md`.
If this file conflicts with repo tooling or explicit user instructions, repo tooling and user instructions win.

## Task Intake
- If the user request is concrete, start with the files directly relevant to that task.
- If the request is not concrete, inspect the top-level documentation most relevant to the task such as `README.md`, package manifests, and module READMEs before deciding where to work.
- Do not assume the task is module-scoped. It may be architectural, debugging, refactoring, review, release, or documentation work.

## Code Change Rules
- Follow `RULES.md` strictly.
- Read every file you modify in full before editing it.
- Do not remove, rename, or downgrade intentional functionality unless the user explicitly asked for it.
- Do not “fix” dependency or type problems by deleting behavior or weakening checks. Prefer the real fix.
- Keep diffs tight. Avoid unrelated refactors and formatting-only churn unless required to satisfy repo rules.

## Validation
- After code changes, run the repository validation commands that enforce the standards in `RULES.md`.
- Treat formatter, lint, warnings-as-errors, tests, and coverage as design constraints, not cleanup steps.
- Do not bypass hooks, checks, or validation steps.
- Never use `--no-verify`.

## Commits
- Never commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- If committing, commit only files changed in this session.
- Use explicit paths when staging. Never use broad staging commands that can capture other agents’ work.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify only intended files are staged.
- If there is a related issue or PR, include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message.

## Git Safety for Parallel Agents
Multiple agents may work in the same worktree. Protect other agents’ changes.

### Allowed
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git add <specific-file-paths>`
- `git commit`
- `git pull --rebase`
- `git push`

### Forbidden
- `git add -A`
- `git add .`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git checkout .`
- `git clean -fd`
- `git stash`
- `git commit --no-verify`
- force push

### Rebase Conflicts
- Resolve conflicts only in files you actually changed.
- If a conflict appears in untouched files, stop and ask the user.

## Issue and PR Review
- When reviewing an issue, read the full issue including comments before acting.
- Prefer complete issue reads over partial snippets.
- Analyze PRs before making local changes.
- Do not open PRs unless the user explicitly asked.
- Do not merge or close anything unless the user explicitly asked.

## Communication Style
- Keep responses concise, direct, and technical.
- No fluff.
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code comments unless the user explicitly asked for them.

## Repository References
- `RULES.md` is the canonical source for:
  - definition of done
  - formatting and lint requirements
  - warnings-as-errors
  - tests and coverage
  - code size and complexity budgets
- `WORKFLOW.md` defines repository workflow for issues, branches, PRs, reviews, and merges.
- `RELEASING.md` defines release, versioning, changelog, tagging, and publishing rules.
